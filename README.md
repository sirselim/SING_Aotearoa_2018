## Bioinformatics â€“ A Genetic and Epigenetic Taster

There are two aspects of what you've learnt so far that we will explore with some basic bioinformatic tools:

  - Populations Genetics
  - Epigenetics
  
## 1. Population Genetics

***Note:*** *The majority of code and data for this section is borrowed from the course GENE360 maintained by Associate Professor Mik Black. You can find the full resource here:* https://github.com/mikblack/GENE360-PopDiv
