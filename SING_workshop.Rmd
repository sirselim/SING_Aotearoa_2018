We're going to be exploring some of the topics that you've covered in genetics and epigenetics the last couple of days. As such this workshop consists of two parts:

  - Population Genetics - how do we explore genetic variation between population? what does this look like? 
  - Epigenetics - can we use epigenetics in a similar way as genetic variation to distinguish cells/tissues?

## 1. Population Genetics

SNP - Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms


## 2. Epigenetics
